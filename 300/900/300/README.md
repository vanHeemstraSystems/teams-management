```

Save the new event, it should show in MS Teams Calendar (provided you have the Team's Calendar visible).

The information about the PI should match what is presented in the PI report out:

<table>
<th colspan="8">PI YYQ##.[SprintNr] - PIPE report out </th><tr/>
<td>Confidence vote</td><td>##/5</td><td colspan="6"></td><tr/>
</table>

Now you can lookup what the Team is working on during the Sprint and contact them easily based on the information contained in the event.
